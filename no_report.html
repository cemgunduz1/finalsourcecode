<h3><b>NORWAY</b></h3>

<p><b>Synchrony Constant: 16</b></p>
<p><b>Population: </b>5.25 million</p>
<p><b>GDP: </b>$398.8 billion </p>
<h1><b>Supplier Power</b></h1>

<p> Our team has determined that the suppliers for fintech companies compete on a global level rather than regional or national due to the nature of the industry, fully dependent on digital technology. Data base, tech and money support don’t vary a lot in different suppliers. Product is not unique (Standardized products). Therefore, supplier power is fixed.					
</p>

<h1><b>Buyer Power</b></h1>

<p>
    Although Norway is spread out on a relatively large area‎ of ‎323,802 km², the number of Norway’s population was counted to be 5.25 million in the 2016
    Thus, capita per km² is relatively low, signifying the store-card transactions to be lower. 
    Moreover, buyers in Norway can relatively easily switch from our client's product to similar products brought out by other banks and financial institutions.
</p>

<h1><b>Threat of Substitution</b></h1>

<p>There are three types of banks in Norway: commercial banks, savings banks (Norwegian: Sparebank) and branches of foreign banks.
    Since the saving banks do not offer store card and other private credit products, 
    the main players of substitution for our client are 18 local commercial and about 30 branches of foreign banks. 
    More than half of these banks offer store card and other private credit products. 
    For example, BN Bank ASA, formerly known as Bolig-og Næringsbanken, is one of the biggest Norwegian commercial banks based in Trondheim with a branch office in Oslo. 
    Owned by the SpareBank 1-alliance, the bank has 50,000 customers and total assets of NOK 48 billion. 
    The bank has specialized in mortgages, private financing and account saving. 
    Overall, threat of substitution in Norway is medium.						
</p>

<h1><b>Threat of New Entry</b></h1>

<p> Norway has a high financial market openness index, indicating that the regulation for entering Norway’s financial field is moderate.
    What’s more, there are 6 major store card companies in the market with no signs of monopoly power here.T
    here is still some room for new entry. Additionally, both store card numbers and transactions show an increasing trend, 
    which is another indicator that helps alleviate the threat of new entry.						
</p>

<h1><b>Industry Rivalry</b></h1>
<p>
    In 2018, there are 749 thousand store cards in Norway, with an increasing trend.
    And store card transactions also show an increasing trend. 
    In company level, there are 6 major fintech companies that provide store cards: Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc, Exxon Mobil Corp, DNB ASA, Johannson, Ikano Group.
    They separately account for 29%, 26%, 10.5%, 8.7%, 7.9%, 4.3% of the total market share. 
    Here, all other firms account for 16% of the market share. It still has some room for new entry (for example, our client). Since the proportion of each top competitor is not very high, there is no monopoly power here. What’s more, the financial openness index of Norway is high. Overall, we give Norway a high score here.
