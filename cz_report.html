<h3><b>CZECH REPUBLIC</b></h3>

<p><b>Synchrony Constant: 15</b></p>
<p><b>Population: </b>10.20 million</p>
<p><b>GDP: </b>$215.7 billion </p>

<h1><b>Supplier Power</b></h1>

<p> Our team has determined that the suppliers for fintech companies compete on a global level rather than regional or national due to the nature of the industry, fully dependent on digital technology. Data base, tech and money support don’t vary a lot in different suppliers. Product is not unique (Standardized products). Therefore, supplier power is fixed.					
</p>

<h1><b>Buyer Power</b></h1>

<p>
        It's interesting when we look at the retail industry in Czech Republic. Retail industry here is actually dominated by foreign companies. The top 1 company is Kaufland from German, followed by Dutch Chain Albert from Netherlands. Germany has the longest border with the Czech Republic. The other significant retailers in terms of number of stores are French, Spanish, British and Americans. Since these are all foreign companies, they may not have as close relationship as local companies have with local banks. So, it may be a good strategy for Synchrony to partner with these companies.			
</p>

<h1><b>Threat of Substitution</b></h1>

<p>
        The number of credit cards in circulation stagnated during 2018 in Czech Republic. Issuers continued to reduce credit card portfolios due to declining returns and card inactivity. There is also a general decline in the popularity of credit cards as issuers continued to reduce their benefits, thereby making credit cards less attractive. However, the transaction volume and value grew as cardholders were able to better utilize their credit cards. The resulting spend per credit card experienced positive growth. We could see that the credit card industry has already passed its mature status and enter into recession status which indicates very low margin in this industry.	             
</p>

<h1><b>Threat of New Entry</b></h1>

<p>The Czech Republic was the second largest recipient of FDI inflows in 2017, owing to the government’s attempts to entice investors to its shores by announcing new incentives: Although FDI intensity fell from 5.0% of GDP in 2016 to 3.4% in 2017, it continues to highlight that FDI is an important economic driver. According to this, we could draw that there is still some kind of threat in Czech Republic but not as large as other countries

</p>

<h1><b>Industry Rivalry</b></h1>
<p>
        The market of Fintech companies is just starting here. It is growing, at a fast pace, but there is no major competitor in this country because almost all of them are just startups and do not have enough capital to compete with Synchrony. If Synchrony chooses to enter into this country, we are pretty sure that Synchrony could make a place here.
